# JUCOD Projects Portfolio

**JUCOD** is a startup I co-founded alongside my wife to design, develop, and maintain custom web solutions for real clients in Mexico and Canada. This initiative gave me hands-on leadership experience in product development, client communications, server management, UX/UI customization, and full-stack development.

The projects below were built using **WordPress**, **WooCommerce**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Elementor**, **cPanel**, and **custom DNS/email configurations**. These solutions span **e-commerce**, **marketing**, and **corporate portfolios**, integrating security, performance, and SEO best practices.
