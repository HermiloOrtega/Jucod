# JUCOD Projects Portfolio

**JUCOD** is a startup I co-founded alongside my wife to design, develop, and maintain custom web solutions for real clients in Mexico and Canada. This initiative gave me hands-on leadership experience in product development, client communications, server management, UX/UI customization, and full-stack development.

The projects below were built using **WordPress**, **WooCommerce**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Elementor**, **cPanel**, and **custom DNS/email configurations**. These solutions span **e-commerce**, **marketing**, and **corporate portfolios**, integrating security, performance, and SEO best practices.

## üìà Career Development & Microsoft Alignment

Through JUCOD, I‚Äôve honed:
- **Client communication skills** through multilingual (Spanish/English) collaboration.
- **Cross-functional agility** managing design, backend, frontend, SEO, and devops.
- **Scalable architecture thinking** even for micro to medium-scale business sites.
- **Problem-solving** with constrained tools (e.g., fixing plugin conflicts, migrating DNS).
- **Ownership mindset** from requirements gathering to final launch and QA.

This experience positions me well for **Microsoft Software Engineering roles** focused on:
- Full-stack systems,

- Optimization and performance at scale,
- Customer-first solutions.
